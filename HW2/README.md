# HW 2
The Code and Experiments are both in [homework_2](homework_2.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook as well as [homework_2_script](homework_2_script.ipynb). <br>
The Theory and explanations are in [homework_2_doc](homework_2_doc.pdf) PDF file.

## Exercises
1. Solve Exercise 3.4. Explain how you obtained the table. Your solution may be hand-written.
2. Write code that solves the linear equations required to find vπ(s) and generate the values in the
table in Figure 3.2. Note that the policy π picks all valid actions in a state with equal probability. Add comments
to your code that explain all your steps.
3. Solve Exercises 3.15 and 3.16.
4. Write code that generates the optimal state-value function and the optimal policy for the
Gridworld in Figure 3.5. You want to solve the corresponding system of non-linear equations. Explain all your
steps.
5. Given an equation for v∗ in terms of q∗.
6. Code policy iteration and value iteration (VI) to solve the Gridworld in Example 4.1. Your code
must log output of each iteration. Pick up a few sample iterations to show policy evaluation and improvement at
work. Similarly, show using a few obtained iterations that every iteration of VI improves the value function. Your
code must include the fix to the bug mentioned in Exercise 4.4.
7. Code exercise 4.7.
